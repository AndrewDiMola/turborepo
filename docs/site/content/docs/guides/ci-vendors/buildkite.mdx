import { PackageManagerTabs, Tab } from '#components/tabs';

The following example shows how to use Turborepo with [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/).

For a given root `package.json`:

```json title="./package.json"
{
  "name": "my-turborepo",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "turbo run build",
    "test": "turbo run test"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "turbo": "latest"
  }
}
```

And a `turbo.json`:

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.com/schema.json",
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": [".next/**", "!.next/cache/**"],
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    }
  }
}
```

Create a file called `.buildkite/pipeline.yml` in your repository with the following contents:

<PackageManagerTabs>

  <Tab value="pnpm">

## Create a Pipeline

To create your pipeline in the Buildkite dashboard, you'll need to first upload the pipeline definition from your repository.

1. Select **Pipelines** to navigate to the Buildkite dashboard.

2. Select **New pipeline**.

3. Enter your pipeline's details in the respective **Name** and **Description** fields.

4. In the **Steps** editor, ensure there's a step to upload the definition from your repository:

```yaml title=".buildkite/pipeline.yml"
steps:
  - label: ':pipeline:'
    command: buildkite-agent pipeline upload
```

5. Select **Create Pipeline**, then click **New Build**, then select **Create Build**.

Run the pipeline whenever you make changes you want to verify.

## Remote Caching

To use Remote Caching, retrieve the team and token for the Remote Cache for your provider. In this example, we'll use [Vercel Remote Cache](https://vercel.com/docs/monorepos/remote-caching):

- `TURBO_TOKEN` - The Bearer token to access the Remote Cache
- `TURBO_TEAM` - The account to which the monorepo belongs

To use Vercel Remote Caching, you can get the value of these variables in a few steps:

1. Create a Scoped Access Token to your account in the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/account/tokens). Copy the value to a safe place. You'll need it in a moment.

2. Make a second secret called `TURBO_TEAM` and enter [your Team URL](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fsettings&title=Find+Team+URL). Copy this value as well. Both values will be used in the next step.

3. Select one of the following secrets storage services plugins and follow the instructions to set both environment variables:
   [AWS SSM](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/aws-assume-role-with-web-identity-buildkite-plugin), [GC Secrets](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/gcp-workload-identity-federation-buildkite-plugin), or [Hashicorp Vault](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/vault-secrets-buildkite-plugin).
   If you cannot use such a service, use the Buildkite agent's `environment` hook to export secrets to a job. For more information, read [Managing pipeline secrets](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/security/secrets/managing).
